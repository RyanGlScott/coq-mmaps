# MMaps : Modular Finite Maps overs Ordered Types

This repository contains several implementations of finite maps over
arbitrary ordered types using Coq functors. This is an udpdated version of
Coq Stdlib's FMaps. It is meant to complement the MSet library, and should
be released alongside it soon.

**Caveat** : This is work-in-progress, and **will** change in the future,
especially `MMapInterface`. In particular, we intent to merge it with another
similar work. This is open source : patches, questions, comments are most welcome !
